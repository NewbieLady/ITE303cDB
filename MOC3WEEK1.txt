A dataset attribute that is not identifiable but constitutes data about the individual that needs to be protected is known as a|sensitive column
K-anonymity in a dataset is achieved when each individual cannot be|distinguished from at least K individuals who are also in the dataset
A major downside to k-anonymity is that re-identification is possible with|multiple datasets
A hospital dataset protects whether an individual has had either a stroke, heart attack, or staph infection. The individual may still be harmed via dataset|group inclusion
A non-sensitive column may become sensitive or even identifiable when viewed through the lens of|algorithmic privacy violations
An example of a public dataset at risk of an algorithmic privacy violation is the|Google Maps satellite view dataset
The Netflix prize privacy scandal is an example of reidentification through|multiple datasets
The nature of a predictive model may reveal ___________|the data it is trained on
An adversarial model relies on using __________ to observe different outputs|perturbed inputs
One way to counter a potential adversarial algorithm is by|limiting precise outputs
